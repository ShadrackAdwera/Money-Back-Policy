            The team offers an 80% money back guarantee on the application development. If you aren’t satisfied with our work, we will refund the money paid.
    This guarantee helps to inspire us to input the maximum possible effort towards your project ensuring you get the best you require at the same time providing you with a great sense of comfort and security.
    
    <p>If you aren’t happy with the design itself or if you aren’t happy with the design process, you simply need to advise us of that fact during the development of your website. We will work and revise till you are 100% satisfied. Or else, if you opt to exercise your rights under the guarantee, we will refund 80% of your money. It’s that simple.</p>
    
    <p>There are a few exceptions, and although it is very unlikely you will want to make use of our guarantee policy, you should understand those rare conditions under which we can’t provide a refund:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>If you have already confirmed or approved the acceptance of a design, we cannot provide a refund. Your approval represents an acceptance of the final project and serves as an implicit statement of satisfaction.</li>
        <li>If you have failed to communicate with us, any refunds will be at the discretion of the development team.</li>
        <li>If the company for whom the design was performed closes, changes its name, or undergoes other alterations rendering a design irrelevant, we cannot issue a refund.</li>
        <li>If you opt to another design firm for service due to pricing or any other reason other than our inability to deliver.</li>
        <li>Where a client proposes changes to design hence altering the delivery period, it will not be acceptable for refund on grounds of inability to deliver within timelines. Once you have taken final delivery.</li>
        <li>
            Our liability is limited to the payment received from you against the project. In case you cancel a project we will have the right to sell or use the designs shown to you as we may deem fit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Should the Customer receive a refund, Customer acknowledges that he/she will have no right (express or implied) to use any Basic concept or other work product, content, or media, nor any ownership interest in or to the same. The Copyright remains with us and you are NOT allowed to use our designs whatsover.
        </li>
        
    
    </ul>
    
    To receive refund, contact the team. Refunds are processed within 30 days from date we acknowledge and confirm we owe you a refund.
